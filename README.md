## Description of Concept

The KETTL network is designed to make the tutoring process more accessible and rewarding. In the KETTL app, students can request help at any time directly from their peers. When they feel comfortable with a class or concept, they can toggle to providing help to others. Rewards are presented to student tutors based on tutoring time that are subsidized by the school's tutoring program.

The KETTL concept is designed to be more flexible and accessible than traditional tutoring.

Additional information about the concept may be appended when it is compiled from hackathon documents.
